You don't get any of that cliche game mechanics that all the latest games have, this is simply good core gameplay. Yes, you can't 360 noscope your friends, but what you can do is show them up with your bad ♥♥♥ dance moves and put them to shame as you show them what true fashion and color combinations are.I know this game says for kids but, this is easily for any age range and any age will have a blast playing this.8/8",2014-06-24

Playing on simple (or easy?) its just the basic WASD keys for driving but (if you want) the game can be much harder and realistic with having to manually change gears, much harder turning, etc. And reversing in this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥, as I imagine it would be with an actual truck. Luckily, you don't have to reverse park it but you get extra points if you do cause it is bloody hard. But this is suprisingly a nice truck driving game and I had a bit of fun with it.",2013-09-08

You get a really early link with characters. No need to play the first game, its nicely wrapped up for you in a five minute video. FYI beware of the sex scenes :P, nudity does happen in the game and it shows you actually having sex, so try not to play with your parents around if your near a point in the story. Also you will need a good rig/comp to play on high. Don't even try running the game on Ultra unless you have mulitiple GPU's (Graphics card) and ram and a good processor.

But since its release in July 2011, it grown to become an outstanding example of Enthusiasm, Humor, and Profound triamph in a game. No matter whether your accomplishing great feats of exploration and scientific achievement......Or maybe you watched your beloved ship erupt into flames and debris becuase of a fatally unseen flaw. There is always something spectacular to be seen (Like your blown-up ship) or something to have a laugh at (Again like your blown-up ship)My recommendation?Buy this game, do something great, do something ridiculous, mod it, find something else just as great and just as crazy to do. My little tip is that i get emotionally attatched to some of my kerbals (Especially Jebediah). There's so much fun to be had and tenderness to experience. There's no reason not to buy this game and experience it. So do it!!!",2015-02-17
50,PPanther,http://steamcommunity.com/id/PPanther,"Last edited December 28, 2014.",211820,No ratings yet,True,"I've always liked games like Terraria with the 2 dimensional survival and exploration aspect and Starbound does all these well and MORE!Lets start with its soundtrack: To sum it up in one paragraph would do it injustice. This games soundtrack is fully orchestral and imersive. The music just fits perfectly where-ever you are in game. Whether you are spelunking or just flying through the vast expanse of space it fits perfectly and leaves you in awe.Ok onto the graphics: The look and feel of this game bring the vast worlds to life with the many colors and alien dirts, trees and the mixture of monsters. The backgrounds of the planets match up the the foregrounds well and give the 2d aspect that 3d feel.Now the gameplay: Starbound has a nice rich layer of gameplay revolving around survival. In the latest unstable build updates they have introduced a very needed layer of missions and npc quests which fullfil the gaps of just flying from planet to planet and give purpose.Starbounds worlds have a wide variety of random aspects to them.First off the flora: Flora of planets consists of 2-3 main aspects. The Trees, the small bushes and medium bushes. Each planet has a vast difference to the next in their flora with trees coming in 2-3 different types from metallic trees to plain out alien tentacles.Now onto the fauna: Each planet has 3 or more ground based animals which increase in strength further beneath the planets surface. Starbound has a feature where animals are customized via their limbs and body. There are many arms, legs, feet and bodies all just jumbled to together from monster to monster making cute monsters and just plain out terrifying ones. There are also around 2 bird species per planet. Using the same general system.I personally suggest this game because of its deep and fluid experience and its wide modding community.8-9/10 for an early access and its only going to get better!",2014-06-07

This is still up for a little improvementsMods can be very fun and after finishing the story i reccomend installing one after finnishing the story.However you should install an ENB asap because it greatly enhances the graphics.,2015-02-13

With the help of the hl2 engine, the graphics, models of weapons and characters, this deserves one of the best shooters game of all time. As well as this, map-making is avaliable to all people who are willing to do it, same with plugins for custom servers, Source Film Maker and many more things. This is overall a stunning game that I have played for a while and deserves a yes. GG Valve.Some things that may put it down, however, would be the fact that some recent updates are very similar in terms of style. For example, the Gun Mettle update brought in contracts, new maps, etc. The halloween update brought in the same thing, but just different missions.People who play other shooter games, that are like COD, Battlefield, etc. One thing i would have to say to those people would be, don't shout at the medic to run to you and specifically YOU because apparantely YOU are the one carrying the team with your gibus and goggles and your natascha, family business and your eviction notice. Pub doesnt work like that, sunshine.As well as this, don't be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to the new kid or some ♥♥♥♥ just because you got screwed over when you were new. At some point this new kid will have a better inventory, (yes i know just because having an expensive inventory doesnt make you a better player) better items, and a better fighting style. TF2 doesnt need those kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥ on their servers.Either way, although there are some parts of the years to come that will be lazy, there will be better things introduced. Frankly, i want some new weapons, they've been just introducing reskins. Example, Batsaber.Yes.",2015-11-27

When all slots are filled it's highly balanced. It's controls are responsive and nothing beats sniping a shark while hanging upside down in the corner with a harpoon.The only problem is the AI. In a game where majority of the gameplay is based off line of sight, and moving without being seen, an AI really destroys it. They can always see you, and never miss as a shark or a diver. They ruin any game almost instantly, but besides that, it's worth buying it when it's on sale.Not entirely sure if it's worth paying full price however, as that's around $80 for you and 3 other friends.

This is not the case. This game is genuinely a masterpiece and i have never played a game that made me feel so many emotions that range all over the spectrum, i mean hell I thought The Last of Us was emotional as hell. one minute its happy then desparation then wanting to cry like a baby (points in the game specifically made me question my manhood due to how much i was trying to not break down like a baby) this game honestly does show alot of great points that are true in real life as well, like value those close to you and despite this being the internet and it not being known to be shown but, showing compassion and taking the time to give a helping hand could possibly save someones life. It is funny that a troll on tf2 would find such a great love and change of perspective from a game, call me names call me what ever the hell you like.

The TF2 community might be at the lowest yet with the new Tough Break update but still even if the biggest people in TF2 such as Jerma985 and Star_ are sick of it I am not it just shows how much this game has dragged me back to it even if I rejected to,eventually I would return and play because I know I want to most my friends that I played TF2 with I barely even see play it but I don't care this game is one of the most special games I've ever played and it was one of the very first games that I've actually stuck around on others I got bored of after getting sick and tired of their repetitive style but still for some reason this game is the only one where I won't stop even if I want to.I'll get to the point of it now I absolutely LOVE and I mean LOVE this game no matter what people tell me about how it isn't as competetive as CS:GO or it is stupid because of how they're always hats on people's heads this game is different from your normal FPS games you actually have to work as a team well to win the game not just run around and shoot people its classes are all balanced and don't handle like COD,Battlefield or CS:GO which shows how different it is so why not give it a try if I and many can enjoy it shows no reason why you can't go download TF2 now and I mean NOW Mr.",2015-12-24

This game is amazing especially if you're a south park fan. This game is a RPG styled game, kinda like Mario and Luigi back in time, you can pick a class to choose between: Fighter, Mage, Thief and Jew. For me personally i liked the Fighter the best, his skills were my favourites. This game is worth the money, although it is short if you rush it (Which i didn't) this game will be worth you're time.

241,Lord_Exploit,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lord_Exploit,"Last edited March 19, 2015.",311560,6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful,True,"So after 30 odd hours i thought i'd write a reasonable review because my thoughts on this game have changed alot. So at first i wasnt so keen on ubisoft relaseasing another game so shortly after Unity, which i think i speak for everyone, despite an attempt at a next-gen engine, it was still average at best. Rogue to me feels like im playing the best bit of the AC franchise, The ship from AC4 and the same unchanged New York map from AC3 to name a few. Some elements from previous multiplayer have also been added in, despite there being an actual multiplayer. My main attractions to Rogue would be the tie-ins to other parts of the franchise, the expansion on the Kenway saga from Black Flag, the Birth of Achillies and his part in AC4 (seems like a sequel, Fast and Furious flash back anyone, *cough* Han *cough*). This also raises another issue i have however, these connections seem very much like Ubisoft are tying loose end to the AC4 and AC3 series, which we saw happen in revelations. Obviosuly this game is far better than Revelations, but is it? im not saying rogue is a cash cow but if the same thing is happening again and ubisoft are working on something in the background, Rogue is nothing more than a slight o' hand (see the pirate reference?), a very visually appealing one at that, they went pretty hard out with this one, even if it is just tying up loose ends and mamking the whole Benjamin Franklin and Achilies issues seem more realistic, it was worth it. Touching on that further, despite being released after PS3/4 and XB360/1, Rogue also had a lower realease cost, which also leads me to believe there is more in store for his franchise, this is in no way the end, ubisoft opened a can of worms by releasing the Templar play with Shay and i personally think it will breathe new light into a somewhat dying franchise.Some things i disagree with:- Bring back the crouch, creates a better sense of realism, i literally walked passed enemies and no one even battered an eye lid. (not legit)- Bring back multiplayer, even if it was only the sailing, i would play that for hours. Seriously, that would have made this game epic. - Hunting is no fun, i dont know anyone who enjoys the hunting challenges.Give this one a go, if you liked the ship from AC4 and Black Flag then its even better here Rogue, Also there is less ""land play"" which made me happy.Have to congratulate Ubisoft here, well rounded game, stable enough for a PC version of AC, playable and enjoyable. P.s Dont take the ship away again.Cheers,Lordelicious.",2015-03-13

It was fun, pretty buggy, but it was full of promise. Skip forward a few years later. The game is worse. Lets talk about starting the game. The game is slow to start. Starting a game will take just as long, and when you get into the game itself, prepare for unoptimized slowness. The game runs terribly, is riddled with bugs and the devs generally don't add any new content. If this was developed by a good indie team, or an AAA team (Oh, did i forgot to mention they fired several people who worked at Bioware, and hired some scrubs?), it would be amazing.

Es allí donde se encuentra el Cristal “GG-3883”, un mineral del planeta Xen que fue capturado para una investigación. Cuando todo marchaba “normalmente” ocurre una pequeña tormenta de portales dentro de la cámara de pruebas seguido de una gran explosión que afecta a todo el sector. Freeman, después de despertar, no solo se encuentra con científicos heridos y/o muertos, sino también con la fauna de Xen que viajaron atreves de una brecha dimensional. Al ver la situación de emergencia en la que se encontraba no solo el sector, sino también todo Black Mesa, inmediatamente sube a la superficie abriéndose paso entre los Xenianos pero al llegar se encuentra con las fuerzas especiales H.E.C.U. que están “silenciando” a todo el personal de Black Mesa y eliminar todas las pruebas del desastre. Al ver la situación, Freeman se mueve a través de todo Black Mesa para llegar al Complejo Lλmbda y cerrar la brecha dimensional antes de que se extienda por todo el mundo…Jugabilidad...Hλlf-Life es una verdadera obra maestra cuando nos referimos a él como un juego “Single Player”, el objetivo del juego es utilizar pensamientos lógicos y nuestro armamento para sobrevivir en un entorno lleno de enemigos con distintas habilidades, también hay situaciones en el que los puzzles (al menos en los primeros días) pueden llegar a ser un problema.Variedad...El arsenal del juego que es muy variado desde armas simples como la Crowbar, Clock 17, Mp5 y Spas 12, hasta armas potentes, tanto militares, experimentales y alienígenas. No es lo único en variación, también hay una gran cantidad de enemigos como los soldados H.E.C.U., las asesinas Blacks Ops, alienígenas de distintos tamaños y poderes e incluso los guardias de seguridad si llegas a causarle heridas intencionalmente. Y la música no se queda atrás, cada escenario tiene su propio ambiente musical que puede generar tensión o adrenalina en el jugador.Innovación...La interacción con los NPC, el modelado y sus animaciones, para su época, eran sorprendentes, a pesar de que en ciertos momentos pueden sufrir de glitches. Los gráficos de ese momento, los efectos de luces y sombras, diseños del entorno y la ambientación, Hacen que el jugador realmente sienta que está dentro del juego, esto es gracias a su motor GoldSrc, una versión modificada del motor Quake.Multijugador...El multijugador de Hλlf-Life tampoco ha quedado de lado, su gran variación de armas, los orificios de bala en las paredes, salpicaduras de sangre o mejor, despedazar los cuerpos de los jugadores, la posibilidad de crear servers dedicados, la gran variedad de mapas incluyendo los oficiales y los que fueron creados por la comunidad, los personajes para controlar aunque en este aspecto hay pocos, aun así el jugador puede agregar más personajes al multijugador aunque los demás jugadores no tendrán la posibilidad de verlo.Mods...Como último punto, el motor GoldSrc, es un motor fácilmente manipulable, tanto que se han creado  varios mods del juego, como los más conocidos como Counter-Strike y Team Fortress, hasta los más olvidados como Deathmatch Classic y Ricochet, aunque estos son mods oficiales, la comunidad ha creado gran variedades de mods como USS Darkstar, Azure Sheep y Sven Coop.Puntos Negativos...Los únicos puntos malos del juego son que en el viaje del inicio es muy largo, aunque esto se puede omitir con la consola, la poca variedad que hay con los aliados, que son solo un científico con cuatro modelos de personajes y un guardia de seguridad, las armas y enemigos de la versión βeta que no aparecieron ni siquiera en el multijugador, y el no incluir la campaña especial “Decay”, un modo de juego exclusivo de Play Station 2 que permite jugar con 2 científicas.GAMEPLAY:             SOUND:                HISTORY:               INNOVATION:★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★DIFFICULTY:            GRAPHICS:              DURATION:             TOTAL:★★★✩✩          ★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★http://store.steampowered.com/app/70",2015-10-28
321,TeCool,http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeCool,,274980,20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful,True,"I'd definitely recommend this game for people who want to expand their vocabulary, but there are a few things I'd like to point out.-While this is almost never required for romance languages, in Japanese, Chinese and Korean, words, Especially adjectives and verbs, can be synonymous but imply different things. This is almost always the case in Japanese, where verbs have transitive and intransitive forms, but this is not listed in the definition, only one form is presented. This means doing research on the word you'll find yourself using more will help you be more fluent in the long run.-So much katakana... I'd like to see really rare kanji forms of words, as they can appear in stories and some videogames (You know, like English games using the words, 'Thee', 'Thou', etc. They're rare because of their age, but they can still find a use in medieval style games!). In fact, I might prefer it that way as I want to learn as much words as possible and converting English to katakana is easy when you learn about how Japanese pronunciation works. Just add a note to say it's rare to avoid confusion.-Some objects are... Odd. I saw this red box and the definition said it was a piggy bank or something, I was confused until I saw a dial, which meant it was a safe. Maybe you should make objects cliched/stereotyped and exaggerated to help people understand with a quick glance.-It doesn't follow spaced repitition, so you can mash the replay button endlessly until you get yourself a star. If you're a serious learner, never press the replay button, as you just bring it back to your short term memory and fail to remember it the next few days, at least space the replays by an hour the *first* time you try it.-Lists make it too easy sometimes, avoid using them and just use the random button, as I found myself just clicking whatever's next to the last object I clicked on, as I was able to remember the next thing I added right after. This is a mnemonic that relies on the location of the object INGAME, so it doesn't really help you learn. If you really want to do lists, run around the whole house clicking random items and adding them to the list, avoiding any sort of order or pattern.And here's some tips for Japanese:-Avoid Romaji, in fact, do kanji, when you don't know a word, you don't know it, there's no improving your ability to decipher meaning from kanji, so just dive right into it. Do kana if you're really keen on learning pronunciation before reading, and want to do it really, really quickly. Same thing probably applies with Pinyin and Hanzi, but I haven't played  the Chinese version so I don't know if Pinyin is provided.-The dots that appear between kana when you look at how to read the kanji is important, memorise the kana in sections divided by the dots, and their associated kanji (e.g. (毎日 [まい＊にち] まい is 毎 and にち is 日)) This is important, words might have multiple readings, and you might get them wrong, but if you memorise at least ONE reading for the kanji, you can type it on a computer, and even get the correct reading by typing the kanji on a dictionary.-While katakana is easy when you know it well enough, sometimes it isn't, as you might say different versions of a word (E.g. Fairy Floss vs. Cotton Candy, (Well, it's neither when translated to Japanese, but you get my point!)) or it's just katakana but isn't based on English, (e.g. パン for bread). Either way, it's nice to learn a ton of katakana in this game as you get badges for it.Other than that, it's good as you'll find objects in an every day home, and the exploration stops you from being bored quickly, and most importantly:It makes you think of (and therefore associate the word you're learning with) objects and pictures, rather than the English translation, which means that you can achieve fluency which allows you to form sentences in the language you want in your head directly, rather than creating an English sentence, translating it to your wanted language, THEN saying, writing or expressing it.",2014-12-15
322,TeCool,http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeCool,,202090,1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful,True,"Best game ever, very little P2W, as all payable items actually can be detrimental to your playing skills, an expert who started with bad equipment will have more potential than a new player who uses very high level equipment, as he'll be used to it and fail really badly when there's an event that measures skill only and gives people similar equipment. Also, all high level equipment are sorted by level, so if you can't buy it with ingame currency, it means specialising isn't a very good idea until you get to a higher level. Payable items don't have this restriction, so very powerful equipment can be put in the hands of new players. Keep in mind that all equipment has a bonus, but an equal penalty, making it not ""powerful"" in a linear sense, but if you specialise in a way that suits your playstyle, it makes you more powerful (but doing this early can bar you from changing your strategy and trying new techniques.)In terms of gameplay, everyone is -mostly- equal, some more general and some more specialized, it depends mostly on skill. Some elements are more powerful than others, not statistically, but in usage and opportunities to cast with most effect.",2014-12-06

It tends to be laggy unless you have a powerful CPU.   You get a wide selection of people because it randomizes it.  One bad thing the hacking is kinda linear its only things that are ran by computers and it limits you on that you cant go and hack a building to turn their lights off (execpt for blackout but my point is you can turn ONE building off).  The multiplayer is not the best but It is not that bad. sure its confusing on how to join multiplayer for your first time but you figure out sometime.

Plus you can take fall damage from sliding down slops so watch out- Loot Crates do spawn all around the map, and there's certain areas where good loot spawns.Loot mostly contains:WeaponsClothesAmmoHealthFinal:As i said the game is still in early access so not everything is in the game, but it still is a great game to playJust don't ♥♥♥♥ off a T-Rex, okay?

The game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you don't actually feel accomplished.-: No storyline, NONE.-: This game is repetitive, most of your objectives in this game are basically 'kill this and receive this' or... 'mine this and receive this'.  Due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking 'why am I even doing this?!'.-: No actual quests, you have a pre-determined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing. You have no freedom to do what you want (that is if you want to actually make progress within the game), you MUST complete the assigned quest to move onto the next one.-: The  entire game  is randomly generated making there feel like there's nothing to actually explore, it's just randomly generated terrain and dungeons (that also seem to be very repetitive). -: You must make an account for the game itself, this isn't so bad on its own however it can be very frustrating trying to get your verification code from your email to work (both me and my friend had the problem).-: Character customization itself is bad, (not the hats, there's plenty of those). there aren't many color options, as far as physical traits just about all you can do is change your skin color (e.g. you cannot change your height, width, etc.).-: Things in the tutorial seem to be out of order, for example around my first hour of gameplay I was being being told the buttons used to attack even though I had already killed loads of enemies.-: Does not have very much music.-: All drops are marked as uncommon/rare+ when it comes to the rarity tag of an item, I've never seen a single item marked as 'common'. I feel the game does this to make you feel more accomplished.This game has/had a lot of potential, it really did. Sadly I have to say that I must give this game a 4/10 for the reasons listed above.",2015-08-01

This should be unlocked towards the end of the game.-	I have three of the eight super powers. I can fly/glide/super jump (all one power), super sprint, and shoot freeze blasts. I’m telling you this just so you have an idea of what to expect.-	You’ll probably never rely on vehicles for transportation after a few upgrades on your super sprint, I like this but at the same time I dislike this.I’ve seen many of the old characters make an appearance so far, it brought me some warm memories.Anyways.. so far I’m really enjoying this game. I can’t say you’ll enjoy SR4 as much as the previous games but if you end up enjoying the super powers you’ll have a lot of fun with this game. I got this for 5$ so I’d say this was well worth the money I spent.",2014-12-27

You may think this game is 2ez4u, but trust me, try it, and you will think differently. This game is the one that you come to when there is nothing to play, the MEGA DOWNFALL is that, its community is dead, there is only about 12 people on. I sat on that game, for 20 minutes on computer, and there was not a single player. On PS4 its alive with a community. We just need more players and you will realise that this game is fun, and not some stoopid game that no one plays. We need just 1 thing to push it up to the surface, and reach 100players at the least, so we can show people this game is awesome!

Between lenient system requirements, a solid (albeit imbalanced, at times) combat system, a funky-♥♥♥ broad permittizzle fo' exploration n' a wide selection of buildin decor, itz tha type of game dat strikes me as havin suttin' fo' everyone. Which is good, when you consider dat it also has multiplayer n' ♥♥♥♥. Even mo' betta when you git ta tha late game, which has a wide array of weapons, armors n' tools ta allow fo' a wide variety of specializations.Buildin n' exploration is phat points up in favor of tha game yo, but tha gameplay mechanics is suttin' I'd like ta single up fo' praise. For a 2D game, its combat system has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of spectacle, n' like thatz part of why I find it so charmin yo. Hurtin enemies--even dem playas whoz ♥♥♥ is vastly inferior ta you--feels good. Y'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! I be fly as a gangbangin' falcon, soarin all up in tha sky dawwwwg! It aint nuthin but satisfyin ta hear tha hit sound on tha mo' squishy enemies, n' peep dem explode tha ♥♥♥♥ into fine lil chunks when they take a thugged-out dirt nap. Ground movement could be mo' betta yo, but certain late game ♥♥♥♥ hit you wit tha mobilitizzle ta dash n' fly, which straight-up expand how tha ♥♥♥♥ you can explore n' fight fo' realz. And wit a wide selection of weapons, every last mutha♥♥♥♥in playa is bound ta find a rosta of tools, spells n' fish-related artillery dat fits they playstyle.Da game aint without flaws, mind yo thugged-out ♥♥♥. With tha gamez update history, tha launch endgame now vastly differs from dat of tha current one. This has hustled ta some balizzle n' progression issues, da most thugged-out glarin of which bein how tha ♥♥♥♥ sluggish tha early game feels. Well shiiiit, it worries me dat tha start of tha game might dissuade some playas from playing, when they might ludd what tha ♥♥♥♥ tha late game has ta offer n' ♥♥♥♥. Da game also has a wack g-thang of recyclin mob AI wit reskins, though dis be averted by adjustin certain parametas n' givin dem unique abilitizzles ta hide tha fact. Even though I have mo' ta say bout tha shortcomings, there be a just too much phat up in tha game ta stay mad bout what tha ♥♥♥♥ effectively boils down ta nitpicking.Plus, it has hats fo' realz. Any game dat has a selection of basebizzle caps gets brownie points.Watch some trailers. Read some other props. If dis be lookin like suttin' you'd be interested in, then take it from me: give Terraria a cold-♥♥♥ lil chance. Da game occasionally goes on sale fo' 75% off, so pick up a gangbangin' four pack fo' yo ♥♥♥ n' three playas. If I be wrong, then I cost you a meal at Subway--not subliminal advertising--and I be sorry as a mutha♥♥♥♥a bout dat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. But if I be right, then it'll be well worth tha price. We sposed ta ♥♥♥♥in pay $60 these minutes fo' a gangbangin' fulfillin gamin experience. This is one that'll run you $10, at most.

Strangely, each character has tha mysterious juice ta fire one or two shots without wack recoil by straight-up briefly jerkin up in tha opposite direction they is movin in. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy ♥♥♥♥♥♥. When yo' character wears a Kevlar vest, every last mutha♥♥♥♥in part of yo' character, except tha head, is made outta steel.

Mo' advanced playas can make glocks materialize outta thin air wit they mind as long as they have tha right amount of scrilla.Maps is often bout evil terrorists tryin ta take a thugged-out dump on deserted places. Vandalizzle be a straight-up straight-up crime up in tha Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists is deployed ta stop em. Unfortunately fo' tha Terrorists, they is dumb n' only packed one bomb. But ♥♥♥♥ dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat tha Counter-Terrorists do not know how tha ♥♥♥♥ ta pick up a thugged-out dropped bomb, so tha Terrorists can still pick it up afta it is dropped by a gangbangin' fallen playa.In some maps, tha terrorists have kidnapped a janitor n' low-level desk jockey up in a funky-♥♥♥ building. Da Counter-Terrorists done been deployed ta save one, not both, of tha hostages. In reality, dis is just a thinly-veiled excuse fo' tha CTs ta cappin' tha Terrorists while pumpin roundz tha ♥♥♥♥ into tha invincible hostages. One weird thang bout hostage maps is dat you can purchase a ""Hostage Rescue Kit"", which somehow make gives you tha mobilitizzle ta put a grown playa on yo' shouldaz up in a second. Y'all KNOW dat ♥♥♥♥, mutha♥♥♥♥a! Perhaps it aint nuthin but a spell scroll dat allows hostages ta hover ta yo' characterz shoulders. Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive be a surprisingly solid game bout playas wit da most thugged-out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ glock handlin abilitizzles eva peeped on Earth. Even though yo' charactas have tha aimin abilitizzlez of one of mah thugs wit Parkinsons Disease, you have nuff tactical options dat make tha game straight-up funk n' dynamic.

Been a Wolfenstein fan from childhood.Machine Games has managed to mix modern shooter features with the old for a very convincing experience. Solid story line and character development, Wolfenstein NO brings the FPS genre backs to its roots with fast pace action based around combat intensity, excitement and less hyper realism that has overtaken the entire genre as of late. No more ducking for cover every five seconds to regenerate your health. Wolfenstein NO makes good use of HP and Armour pick ups that allows the player to feel more apart of the story rather than just a bystander.I can't rave enough about the gun play in this game, amazing gun selection and design, almost every weapon can be dual-wielded. A good variety of weapons that all have different uses which help foster and encourage different play styles eg. stealth or open combat. This game has put to rest the argument that every FPS must embrace a multiplayer feature. While I hope due to the success of Wolfenstein NO a standalone multiplayer is developed in the future that echos the Enemy Territory model of earlier Wolfenstein games, this game easily stands tall on its singleplayer features alone.With multiple difficulties, different characters and a meaningful collectibles feature that unlocks four very unique gameplay modes, this game has plenty of replay-ability and could easily be enjoyed for many playthroughs. I don't normally like DLC but I really hope this game gets some side mission or extended story line DLC and fingers crossed a sequel in the coming year or two.Hats off to Machine Games for crafting an enjoyable singleplayer FPS in an era where everyone is obsessed with multiplayer and for standing by their development goals till completion to produce a solid product. Props also to Bethesda for backing a  studio with great talent and vision. Hope you enjoy this game as much as I did.",2014-06-04

Payday is a first-person bank robbing ,meth cooking, painting stealing simulator and its extremely adictive.  With many different hiest to choose from, bank robbing to cocaine dealing you can aproach each mission in any way you like from equiping the heaviest armor and the strongest gun and going loud to rob a bank to going slow and steady in stealth which does come with a experience bonus. The game is very costumisable from choosing your armor, gun, mask all the way down to your melee. But out of the the costumising you will ever do is your mask whcich defines who you are with over 100 mask to choose from and over 100 different colours and patterns no one ever has the same mask.But all up its a very enjoyable game stealth, loud, with or without friends it dosen't matter the circumstances its a great game for those who enjoy co-op strategic shooter i recomend it to all for only 30 dollars its a great pick up.

When you have your back to the wall, facing down a Fleshpound and a Scrake, with nothing left but a knife and dead teammates, it really makes your adrenaline kick in. The fact that this game is generally focussed on (but not limited to) multiplayer and teamwork is what makes it that much more enjoyable. Why face hordes of endless flesh-eating creatures alone, when you can share the fun of burning them, blowing them up and hacking them apart with a team?

Rockets are good as short burst damage output, but they can be easily dodged and the player usually switches weapons after.

It ruins the experience if your constantly finding bugs that may be small still ruin things or make the game frustrating. Another major concern i have is that you need a pretty damn good rig in order to run this, i can usually run all my games (Steam and non-steam) at their highest settings, ARK however for whatever reason i have severe trouble to run on even its lowest settings. Now i know some of you will go ""Get a better rig"" well that doesn't solve much as it is the job of the Dev team to make the game accessible to as many people as they can, and in order to do that they need to get on top of fixing and optimising the game rather than adding more features. so no i can't reccommend the game IN ITS CURRENT STATE, however if the Dev team is able to address the many issues with this game and do something simmilar to what Space Engineers is doing right now, where the devs arehalting addition of features and are just focusing on fixing the current bugs, then i'd give it a positive review...",2015-09-13

Good luck as this game was designed for the console peasant industry. Terrible pc optimization and mechanics is something which plague GTA IV.

This game offers very little new content, with half the assassins ending up being overshadowed side mission that don't do the characters justice.The game itself is still quite good, with most of the core mechanics remaining the same. Movements, expecially grappling and gliding are a little off, and the combat (with the City approach of 'more guys = harder) starts to show it's flaws when surrounded by 20+ enemies.Overall, this game still has a very solid core to it, and should definitely be played. Yes, it is the weakest in the series, but that is because the first two were so strong. Some of the elements of this game are nicely done, just pretend multiplayer doesn't exist though. Writing (although I personally did not like the story) is quite nicely done, and everything about this game still holds it's own.The weakest part of this game is that it is the third in a series, and it is definitely a step backwards. If this was a first up game, we would still highlight the flaws but could see the room for improvment. The sad fact is that there have been two games already that have overall been better. But I do encourage you to play this game, because it is still the same engine and gameplay as the first two - and that is still a damn good thing.",2013-11-25

With over 100 levels, dozens of unlockables, lovely visuals and a wonderful soundtrack this game is a really delight to play.The premise is simple: get from one end of the level to the other in a free-flowing smooth run. But this game is not for the people who have slow reactions times or get frustrated easily. It is hard, and quite unforgiving. Repetition is going to happening in this game, but because of the quick reload and charming music, it's hard to feel put out.When you do get a great run going, it's fantastic. All the notes and melodies stiched together with your actions makes it a grand way to know you're doing well. Not to mention that it also helps timing your moments with the logical note progression.Over the multiple different worlds, there are retro levels, multiple paths and different bosses to change things up, and the dastardly combinations of different moments makes you really appreciate the level design - which may appear simplistic at times - but it very finely tuned.This game is great in short bursts for those that don't have much time, it's great for those wanting a challenge, and especially if you like the recognition for seamlessly stringing together your levels and actions. Everything about this game screams that the developer cared about making their game. From the cutscenes narrated by Charles Martinet (who also does the voice for Mario) right down to the charming animations and fluid movement.This game is something you should seriously consider purchasing, playing, loving and then realising that you have to do the whole game on all three difficulties and then all the extras and then costumes and then...",2013-11-25

If you’re looking to have fun with mate or just by yourself, play, BF4, COD (Not ghost) or B2. I found that the actual shooters elements of the game is dull. Yeah, you got skyhooks and things around you, which are very handy, but the amount of enemies I had to face was annoying and at times, boring. You also can only have 2 weapons at a time. But what I did like was the power ups, which all had different uses. But for half the game I used like 2 of them, which I think they're is like over 7 or something. So why is this game so good? This game really shines, and is utterly unbeaten, with its engaging storyline. What a story, I never thought a game could engage me and make me care about the characters like this. I kept pushing on the average shooter because of this story. Also, there is a lot of freedom for the play, or as it seems. The graphics is more than good and the city is really awesome to, which you get to explore bits and pieces of the downtown dark alley ways to the wealth and good looking streets, parks, houses and more. So overall, this game is a masterpiece in its own right, and has defiantly set a new started in terms of storytelling games. (P.S. The ending will blow you away and I played most of this game on the PS3)8.5/10",2014-03-26

This game is obviously a failure of a Call of Duty clone. The level up system seems to use unrealistic millitary ranks. I mean, what the ♥♥♥♥ is a ""Powder Monkey?"" You also lack the ability to prestige making replayability nil. The weapons.... Oh dear. You don't even get to hold the guns. They are mounted onto your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vehicle and the aiming is horrible. Most guns don't even have ♥♥♥♥ing iron sights. And here it comes.... the worst part... the ♥♥♥♥ing sniper rifle. You heard me, sniper rifle. There is only one of those in the game and the idiots that made the game called it the ""Mercury Field Gun"" thinking it sounds cool or some ♥♥♥♥. Well it doesn't you filthy hipsters, just admit its mean't to be called the L96A1 Bolt Action Rifle. Oh yeah, I forgot. ITS NOT EVEN BOLT ACTION AND IT ONLY HAS 2 BULLETS.

I am a GIANT clicker fan, starting with cookie clicker, to Adventure Capatalist (of what is more of an Idle game) to Clicker Heroes! But this clicker is my favourite.  Here's why.1. It has AIMING! As with all bland games, aiming makes things better! Such as my favourite MMO of all time, Wildstar.So when this clicker had aiming I knew it was worth a ""Shot"". (Yes, that was a pun).2. It was based on one of the coolest games in the VR Universe, Time Rifters. To be based in the same scenery is a lovely trip to your brains memory compartment, if you haven't seen that game, then it's just a cool place to be in general.3. Its got great progression! Not at one point did I feel It was going too fast or too slow, and when I needed money the most, a Rainbow Money Ball would come along and help me out!So in total this is the greatest Clicker/Idle/Shooter of all time! If you are not sure, give it a try!",2015-07-26

I got it when it was $55 and I still don't regret it. I didn't like the DS ones but this one takes the DELICOUS MASSIVE CAKE! But let's talk detail.This game is literally a dictionary stuffed inside cartoon graphics and zapped with story, and I'm okay with that. The story isn't half bad, the level design is fabulous and the graphics is eye candy. There are afew flaws, some times words entered aren't adapted and it won't help you spell your workshop creations (I happen to have made afew) so it can be a little tedious when trying to make somthing specific. Don't make somthing specific! Go nuts! I come back to it even with the story complete just to make some crazy stuff.

You can also  lvl up  geometry skill which will allow you to mine higher lvl rocks and get more resorces from them, as far as pvp goes i have yet to try it out. I find that melee is a good skill to start lvling up right away because it can become handy later on, also the quest system is nice filled with different varieties and you never feel as if you have done the same quest more that twice.The map is HUGE and would take hours to explore and going out past a certain point you will find that enemies will get tougher very quickly which will force you to lvl up before exploring more which is good because when you die from a hard enemy and then go lvl up a little bit when you go back to that same enemy you feel like you are getting stronger and making progress towards you'r character. I very much enjoy a few hours a day of fallen earth and would easily give it an 8/10 for mmo standards.

922,bohgeraltofrivia,http://steamcommunity.com/id/bohgeraltofrivia,"Last edited November 12, 2014.",261640,0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful,True,"Where to start. Well I'm in it so it's guaranteed to be epic. All jokes aside though the game is awesome, and you can read my review to know more.The game overall is awesome, it's like borderlands 2, but it's better. The Scaling in BL2, was horrible from level 50 upwards. You need OP and Gamebreaking gear to get anywhere in the game fomr UVHM onwards. And I can already see the scaling in this game is a lot better. I'm able to now use Purple guns to defeat a raid boss, solo. The visuals, can be a little repetitive at times, but overall they are appealing and does bring different environments into the game. Now as for gameplay, well, many, including me who had seen the gameplay, thought that the butt-stomp ability would be a gimmick in the game that I would never use. I was wrong. It adds so much more to the combat, in addition with the low gravity, killing is a lot more fluid, getting around on foot isn't so boresome, and depending on how you use your ""double jump"", and where you activate the extra boost, gives completely different outcomes. For example, if I need to get to a higher ledge, a jump and boost when i'm halfway until the fulcrum of my jump, giving me a way higher jump. But If I was to say get passed a very wide crevice I would start sprinting, jump then activate the boost before I start descending. And this all may seem simple, but it can be applied to the combat maneuvres and it overall makes combat more pleasing. I particularly like to use the second descripted type of jump a lot when traversing without a vehicle, it practically triples my movement time and comes in handy, even in the normal gravity environments, such as Helios.Now for Classes. Of course everyone started the game as claptrap, so i'm going to go and do something different like I usually do, I played the game as Nisha, speccing into her middle and right trees, and found myself being basically a god, maybe here is where the teamwork really comes into play. Having all 4 Nisha's running around wouldn't work, because you have no way of healing or buffing teammates. Nisha is a very combat centred solo class. And I would say she is needed for every kind of boss fight, she deals damage and deals it where it matters. Claptrap, is a must have, he gives the team random buffs, and helps out alot with co-op, lots of health boosts, dmg boosts etc. Athena plays the role of the tank healer, she is a great class to play as with friends, although solo not so much. Her abilities are a lot like Maya's except she soaks up damage. She is also a vital part to the team, giving out lots of Health regen. I didn't play wilhelm much, but from what I did, He is just a straight up tank class. He takes all of the damage dealt while dealing a fair enough amount of damage. He is the most Balanced class from what i've played of him but isn't very fun (for lack of better term), So overall the classes have their own Pros and cons and they all do their own special thing that makes them vital to the team.As an overall, I'd say the game does use lots of content from Borderlands 2, including some legendaries and renamed Unique guns. The humour is a step up from Borderlands 2 and as an Australian I did get all of the jokes, so that could be a downside for some players who don't know much of Australian slang and colloquialism. But yes, the humour is well done and implemented, the story is EXCELLENT. I love it. *No spoilers* I hate lilith for what she did to jack, and I empathised for Jack as the hours passed. Some of the negative reviews here state that the campaign didn't give enough XP to get to the required levels, but that's because they didn't do the side missions, which were frankly better this time around. There is a lot more variety and SO MUCH story to be told in the side missions, like how Terramorphous made it onto Pandora, when Threshers where only a Moon Species (DAMN YOU HAMMERLOCK), or how Jack comes up with the idea of Moonshotting loaders to Pandora etc. Lots of things storywise are excellent, with a nice twist on Jack at the end and how he gets the scar on his face. The story just blew my mind the first time around, and I stuck around long enough for 3 more playthroughs up to TVHM and still find it enjoyable. I especially can't wait for the UVHM pack that will have a new Narrative Voice over along with Tiny Tina. Overall Game was excellent.Now for a short list of Pros and Cons incase you don't want to read all that garbage.Pros:- Story- Classes- Visuals- Soundtrack- Gameplay- Combat- Low Gravity- Enemy Scaling- Weapon Scaling- Replayability (I'd die if I didn't put that in there)Cons:- Nisha and Claptrap are the only 2 classes that are really enjoyable in SP and MP- Wilhelm and Athena lack enough SP Skills to play SP, but are both great for MP- Not as many legendaries- Maybe too many reused Borderlands 2 Assets- Comedy can get a little dry after a whileAnyway that's my Review of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel I give this game an overall of:8.7/10. It's more of the same which isn't bad, it still has that Borderlands Charm, it delivers where in lots of ways Borderlands 2 failed. And even though it seems mediocre amongst many giants coming out this year, it's defenitely my Game of the Year. I can't wait for the Doppelganger Pack release tomorrow, and like i've said many many times. This game overall is excellents. It's a must buy for borderlands fans, and a must buy if you want to try out the series. TL;DR Game overall is excellent, more of the same Borderlands you love while changing it up a bit. New players will love it, while old fans will cherish it.",2014-11-11

It was true at the time but since then the game has been abandoned by the developers, traded in for the PS4 version instead. They ceased development on the PC version and have since closed down the Australian servers, making it unplayable for anyone in the area (including myself). The matchmaking for other servers is garbage as well, taking decades to find a lobby.This game is trash now and I'm glad to be not installing it again after reading the reviews for the game, and now giving my own.

I know a lot of work has gone into this game, and a lot more hours will be spent making it the greatest it can be.Pro's- Closest thing to Harvest Moon itself.- Love the details/graphics- Calming Tunes ( May get annoying after awhile )- Easy to waste a year of your life away- Early Access, ( room for improvement )- Somewhat playable- Playable via Steam- Fast and easy start up- many, many more, and I'm sure i'll have more to add when I've played more hours.Cons; Annoying Features/bugs/Glitches I noticed. (JUST BECAUSE THERE'S MORE CONS THAN PRO'S, DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A BAD GAME)- Spelling Mistakes, such as, On the sign at the farm, 'ax'. ""they're reactions are similar"", The mayor says 'they's instead of they'd ""- overused words( Dear,Gotcha,Getcha ) makes it seem unprofessional when it's there twice a sentence,- not too detailed about the actual things you need to know- walking through doors sideways and not where the door is.( On the mayors tour )- mayor disappears in the General Shop when first meeting- mistaken he/she at the farm when clearly accepted was a she.. and then says she in the next sentence.- ""they're reactions are similar""- random 0 when mayor talks about the animal attacks at the start- few music tunes from harvest moon(friends of mineral town+TreeOfTranquility). - First person to visit the farm repeats before roselyn/jessica shows back up- Massive random line of b when jessica shows the above view of town- sleep and save is glitched, Can't save, - can't sleep ( option comes up, is accepted and then nothing happens )- start is an hour long-  No sound effects ( tools, people, walking etc )- Farm Layout Is basically EXACTLY like Harvest moon ( No Originality )- Turnip Seeds glitching and becoming infinite at the start- Controls are bugged and seem to not work ( Interact Button, even when changed. Also Escape for back comes up with exit option, everytime. )",2015-05-06

Thus, Rust had nothing more to offer for me and I completely stopped playing it.- EARLY EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -Rust well.. It's different.It may be in Alpha but it's already such a great game, I'm excited and dreading new updates, I love the way it is at the moment, not knowing if the upcoming developments will ruin what i think or make it even better, going to have to wait and find out, I spend most of my time playing this game, Surely enough playing on a populated server isn't a good idea, it'll ruin your experience all together, the key is to find a decent server with only about 20-40 people online, i'd say start off with a pve until you get the hang of things. Also playing on Official servers aren't exactly the best idea.Wolves and bears have a fair amount of health compared to the zombies, bears and wolves you have to avoid until you have a bow or a gun, zombies you can take on with a pickaxe etc. This is a great game and definitely worth the money, considering it's in Alpha, it's damn well good.I thought it'd be one of those games that look great but turn out pretty bad, Looks great, is great.The only downer for me is the fact it over heats my laptop, and that's when I play with Render Quality 0, and run it on the fastest option. The graphics are great.. but I can't really play with them. I have a decent gaming laptop.. but still It overheats so I have to take breaks and I don't like that.All in all, Great game, definitely worth a look at :)I'm sure more people would buy it if there was a demo, then again it's in alpha and only $20, Still worth a look :)I surely don't regret this game and I won't anytime soon =D",2014-02-04

Has been for months and will continue to be, I'm hoping there's a part 2, or a completely new game, the graphics are amazing, vocals are awesome, missions, hidden artifacts, tombs, wolves, good guys, bad guys, and that's just the campaign, I played for 13 hours, 6 and a half hours for 2 days, I couldn't stop. It's like finding a good book and not putting It down.buying this on sale would be a massive rip off, It's worth full price and so much more.

Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering ""should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead"". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can't really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game).",2014-11-14

It could easily get a 10/10 if there were more voice commands (lacking important voice commands such as ""No""), different character customisation abilities such as color (in FFA matches).

When you first start playing things can seem a bit overwhelming and especially if you're playing online not everyone is forgiving towards new players, but its definately easier to complete jobs online than with bots offline. the only thing that was disappointing was that its alot more work to create custom masks than i feel its worth, you need any combination of 3 components to make one: material, pattern, and paint. and the only way to get anyone of these at a time is as a random drop at the end of each completed mission, but you also have the chance of getting bonus cash, bonus xp, or a weapon mod (mods that you have to pay ludicrous amounts for to then actually use anyway, so thats another thing), but overall its an exellent game and highly recomended. dont feel bad if you're a lpw level, it doesnt take long to level up online and doing more difficult jobs with higher level plays who can carry you through jobs.",2014-08-12

Ultimately, i feel like the reward system is a bit harsh because you have to buy the same things multiple times if you want to use more than one mech, but other than that its a great game and i highly recommend it",2014-04-26

Mission settings such as ""onsluaght mode"" makes things interesting in the sense that you can have it off and run through the missions as intended and take your time, or turn it on to penalize slow movement due to massive hoardes that... well swarm... you every minute whether you move or not. Vast types of aliens keeps you on your toes and its a game thats overall pretty simple to learn (also has offline practice that offers hints or for you to test different load outs which is fun), then if you havent played in a while you can get right back into it, just like riding a bike",2014-03-20

The fact you have abilities and stats for each unit (Orks being more offensive, while Space marines defensive.) and being able to attack pieces at range / if they are a terminator or assault marine they can melee adjacent units. I found some of my strategies failed because they would be bombarded by units. If this was the final game I admit I would be unimpressed but the fact there are plenty of other modes coming and a campaign and more. I think its worth it.

I can remember the times when you progress into new teirs and levels, unlocking different armours, weapons, and utilities. This was great fun up to this point - until alll of a sudden - the updates happened. The diversity of different tiers and levels, dissapeared - the uniqueness of designs, gone - The all-round game play, terrible.What made this game so bad in the end, was the fact that they decided to take all the hard work, grinding, and time off all the users, and just deleted it. Sent everyone back to an abysmal tech tree which made a level 100 and a level 1 the same sturdiness (armour wise). And the devs didnt even refund those who lost their hard earned robots.The development team needs to recognise that what they are/have done has turned a great oppurtunity into a train wreck. This CAN CLEARLY BE SEEN IN REVIEWS. Unless drastic restorations to the game are conducted. YOU WILL NOT ENJOY THIS GAME.",2015-05-11

The stealth is way to easy aswell like orcs are just way too stupid and the attract button makes the game way to easy.  The nemesis system is good either having like your own army withing the system or let the orcs fight themselves within the system and see how they progress within the army. Final verdict its alot of fun! messing around with the orcs the brutal final blow kills are brutal! and having to choose to stealth or run in like a maniac always keeps the game fun and entertaining i was just dissapointed with the story of the game.",2014-10-13

It has three game modes including single and co op campaign with 6 different races. The campaign can be set on easy, normal, hard and very hard.  The second game mode is multiplayer. You can also choose of 6 different races and their costume colors. You can do many different things on multiplayer, for e.g: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 etc. But my personal favourite is Last Stand. You can choose out of 6 races (or 7 if you have dlc) and can the play on two different maps. You play with three different people and as you gain more experience you can make your character stronger by giving him armor, weapons, and traits and abilities.

I havent felt this way about finishing a game since To The Moon and Solatorobo. I wasnt sad because of the story, I was sad because the journey was over.

1312,ConkerBirdy,http://steamcommunity.com/id/ConkerBirdy,,239140,2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful,True,"This game is surprisingly good, I recommend it if youre looking for a new coop game to play with friends or just a nice open world game mixed with parkour. Story (6/10):  While nothing special it does have its set of memorable characters. The main cast is pretty average and forgettable but the characters in the side quests are hilariously whacky and memorable. Graphics (8/10):  The game is absolutely beautiful and has flawless triple monitor support. You can see ripples on the clothing, grass and trees moving in the wind which only gets better during raining and storming weather. The facial animations on non story critical characters are a little stiff but the animations are pretty good otherwise.  Gameplay (8/10):  The gameplay is pretty good and the parkour is pretty smooth, it may be no mirrors edge but it still boasts a lot of similar parkour. The melee combat is where the game shines with upgradable melee weapons that degrade over time, you can get perks to help make your weapons last longer but even at higher level youre still watching your melee weapon usage. The gun play is pretty good and im disappointed the guns dont wear down Far Cry 2 style but it balances out since melee weapons do more damage.The night time can be absolutely terrifying right up until higher levels, my first experience with night time was an adrenaline rush even in coop.The game will feel very familiar to those who've played Mirror's Edge and as a fan of Mirror's Edge, i can easily recommend this game for those looking for a new parkour game. Controls:  I'm not giving a score on this since I played it on both PC and Xbox 360 controller controls, so I'll write a mini review for it.The PC controls are pretty good but the mouse sensivity takes time to get used to (i really cant explain this problem) but it still feels very natural compared to most multiplatform titles. The Xbox 360 controlers however, are clunky and take a lot of time getting used to but still very playable ones used to it. Coop (8/10):  The coop is pretty damn good, its peer2peer and you join the client's game and you do their quests and story. Its drop in and drop out so you can leave and join anytime. The ""Be The Zombie"" gamemode is similar to the Dark Souls invasion and can make even the most battle hardened survivors work together. I really recommend this game if youre tired of all the current coop zombie games like CoD zombies, Left 4 Dead 2 and Killing Floor. Technical Info:  This game isnt quite optimized for PC and my first 5-10 hours involved me having a problem where the cutscenes would run at 15fps despite pulling 40fps in triple screen resolution (5760x1080) and apparently its coming problem but looks like its fixed now (it happened to different people no matter the resolution or setup).The game has flawless triple monitor support and the side screens darken when entering cinematics. I recommend keeping ""View Distance"" at the default or turning it down because it has a major performance impact for little effect (it just makes foliage more visible in the distance, thats it).Apparently this game has very very basic Oculus Rift support but I havent tested it until they get something worth testing.",2015-02-21

Jack Black does a fantastic job at giving life to the character Eddie, and the appearance of Ozzie Osbourne is very amusing too. Full of action (the gore option is hilarious) and great comedic dialogue. Awesome game, would totally recommend to anyone with a metal edge or a fan of Jack Black's!",2014-02-14
1351,kggj,http://steamcommunity.com/id/kggj,,239350,No ratings yet,True,"One of the best indie games ever made. Spelunky is randomly generated done right. The game is always a challenge, and at the start may seem repetitive or frustrating, but the more time you pour into this game, time this game deserves, the more you will notice the complexity and fascinating level of depth the game has.GameplayThe game might not be for everyone, in that victory is not guaranteed and a simple mistake may mean restarting from the first level of the game. You play as a spelunker and a boiled down summary of the aim of the game is to get to the next level by maneuvering from the top of the level to the exit at the bottom, all the while avoiding a multitude of enemies and traps. Each playable character (and there are a variety to choose from) is equipped with a whip to kill enemies or smash pots or deflect arrows. Really it serves as a multipurpose tool.GraphicsColourful, vibrant and beautiful 2D art that complements the game perfectly. Pretty explosion effects. It is a nice looking game.ReplayabilityConceivably infinite. Every level is different as they are all randomly generated. It is highly unlikely you will ever play the same level twice and if you did you would most likely not notice as you'd be too busy whipping bats and jumping spikes and enjoying avoiding death.It took me 100 hours of co-op to beat the game with my brother and that was most fulfilling experience ever. And technically I haven't actually beaten the game yet as I only defeated one of the games bosses.Highly recommend this game. 10/10",2015-01-20
1352,kggj,http://steamcommunity.com/id/kggj,,219150,No ratings yet,True,"The game is fun. Invite friends over and take turns getting killed in visceral, blood-splashing 8-bit detail. The game might not be for everyone; if you don't like pixel art games, if you don't like killing people, if you don't like trippy 80s inspired psychaedelic visuals or collecting animal masks, then this game might not be for you. It's fun, it's fast, it's infuriating and, importantly, it's rewarding.For only $10, Hotline Miami is a bloody steal.",2015-01-20

And also that not just weapons and a frame but also a new ship as well which is an improvement to having a new kind of ship which you will need to find the parts and buy the blueprint in the shop and once your done making it, you have yourself a new ship.

1360,ElementalGodChaos,http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElementalGodChaos,,440,No ratings yet,False,"Ok I just have to say this, I have once liked TF2 but after some time of playing this game i have slowly started to hate this game so much, reasons why you might want to ask me is that i have not really liked the admins of certain cervers (mainly the two pony cervers im on and some others as well) with getting new ones and getting rid of once good ones who i have actually liked. This game is also used for the shop which is used for the keys to unlock these crates that are usually what you might get over a nice weapon or a rare chance of a simple hat. But honestly do people really want to spend over 30 or maybe 60 but not even exactly 100 dollars on some stupid ♥♥♥ ring that no one will ever buy for unless they really wanted to spend it on that damn thing, I say no you can get anything you wanted thats not some cosmetic item for your classes to all wear but i say that these items that i have seen and the new things that have even appeared in this game are just useless, all you get are some weapons or the main thing of hats which i have seen over the time that i have played this damn game. But unlike other games i have seen or played such as CS:GO also do the same thing with the shopping mechanism of the keys and crates for weapons. But as for TF2 I would say that i wouldn't even dare to touch or play this game even if they have made some good buffs but after that gunn metel update it just made it all go away for me and started to not even play it one single bit. Now if anyone would give me a single reason as to why i should play this game and i mean a good one not that ""its so fun and amazing and that you can play with friend"" just like any other game i have and that one of my friends have to play on i want a really good reason that you can easily persuade me to start this game up again once more and to prove that it will be worth my while then i will be playing it but otherwise i am not playing it worth anything even if i were to get an unusual which would cost me something or if anyone gave it to me for free.

Besides getting yelled at by friends and the case of the removals, this game is worth the money. If you ever get bored and/or beat the game, there is an excellent collection of mods at the workshop and a website called nexus mods.

Whether due to shifting market trends or a mid-life identity crisis, the Golden Arches has decided to completely reinvent itself as an upmarket restaurant chain. It’s a bold new direction for the company with a focus on premium ingredients, dine-in perks and customer creation via “Build-A-Burger” touch screens. Yesterday, we tested the fancy new service at its maiden store in Castle Hill, NSW. The results exceeded our wildest expectations.Study the above photo. It doesn’t look like your typical Macca’s fare, does it? Remove the tell-tale cup and it could almost be a burger from a glitzy steak house or high-end pub. What you’re looking at is a bespoke burger packed with an Angus beef patty, lettuce, tomato, egg, smoked Applewood bacon, red onion rings, jalapenos, grilled mushrooms, chilli jam and no less than four types of cheeses. (Yep, I went all in and I don’t regret a thing — but more on that later.)This is what McDonald’s wants to become in Australia and it’s pulling out all the stops to make it happen. While the service is currently only available in a single Castle Hill outlet, the company is embarking on a nation-wide roll out over the next two years. Consider it the final step in McDonald’s hipster gentrification (hipsterfication?) — a process that arguably started with the Angus and M Selection range.So how does it work? If you just want to grab a quick ‘n’ dirty Big Mac, McDonald’s will still cater to you via the usual ordering process. However, there’s also a touch screen kiosk where customers can get a whole lot fancier. There are several ready-built deluxe burgers to choose from, although the emphasis is firmly on customer creation.There are more than 30 ingredients to choose from, including two types of buns, four kinds of cheese, two types of bacon and a range of specialty toppings including grilled pineapple, guacamole, beetroot, grilled mushrooms and a range of gourmet sauces. Handily, the display automatically tallies the kilojoule count of your order after you’ve added all the toppings.The touch screen interface has been built to impress: it’s large, responsive and easy to navigate with visual representations of all the available ingredients. With the possible exception of geriatric Luddites, the UI shouldn’t give customers any trouble. (Trained staff are hovering nearby just in case you have any questions.) You can also order standard menu items from the touch screen, which means you don’t have to split from your lunch partner if they just want a Quarter Pounder.Once you’ve made your selection you can pay for it instantly via an inbuilt credit card terminal. You’re then presented with a receipt and invited to sit down as your meal is freshly prepared. It will then be served to you on a dinky wooden platter. (Plastic trays are for bogans, dontcha know.)The new menu doesn’t look like fast food and it doesn’t act like it either: waiting times are significantly longer than McDonald’s customers are accustomed to. It took close to 15 minutes for my order to arrive by which point I was completely famished. Mind you, this is fairly typical for a non-fast-food burger so I won’t begrudge them too much.Just be aware that you might be in for an even lengthier wait during peak meal times. The manager I spoke to admitted that things can slow to a crawl when lots of bespoke orders come in at once. If your time is limited, our advice is to show up at least an hour before the lunch/dinner crowd.When my burger finally arrived, I was immediately impressed with the size and construction. If the ready-made options are anything like this, we may have the first perfect Takeaway Truth score on our hands. But looks can be deceiving. For as long as anyone can remember, McDonald’s has been synonymous with cheap, bland food. Would this be more of the same with a higher price tag?The answer is an emphatic no. Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the best McDonald’s burger I’ve tasted by a significant margin. It may even be my favourite fast food burger, period. The combination of familiar Macca’s meat and gourmet toppings went together wonderfully. My only reservation is that it was a bit hard to eat due to its massive size. Annoyingly, McDonald’s doesn’t include plastic cutlery with orders unless you ask.Apart from that tiny caveat, I really don’t have anything mean to say about this burger or the upscale service that spawned it. Would I pay $30 for a version with the lot? Of course not. But for $15 or so, this is a perfectly acceptable meal — attractive, delicious and so very filling.In conclusion, McDonald’s has clearly realised it needs to adapt with the times and it is moving confidently in the right direction. Fast food just got a serious upgrade. Colour us excited.",2015-06-25

If you like AC games, play any of the far better original ones, like AC brotherhood, if you are new to AC games, don't let this poor mockery ruin your view of the series. EVERYTHING has been sacrificed to make it co op. Combat has finally been made slightly harder, but is now ruined due to parries and dodges working maybe 50% of the time, and having common street brawlers fight better than an assassin is pretty pathetic. the renowned fps issues and other strange glitches are really just another layer of incompitence on top of the already poor excuse for an AC game.

You start with an Copper Shortsword, Copper Pickaxe and Copper Axe. 100 HP and 20 Mana. I Can tell, there is alot of youtubers that almost do only terraria videos. Examples: Yrimir, HERO, Chippygaming, TerrariaHelp, meetyourdemize, then others. You can build alot of things, and get even much stronger that you started, or even, get all of the rarest items on the game, also it has support to mods and texturepacks.

I've gotta say.. I enjoyed it. In it you play as two characters, Rhys and Fiona. You then recount events from each of their points of views and play out events in the past, affecting their futures, Got it? Good.Pros:+Good voice acting+Longer length ( about 2 hours and 30 minutes )+More interactive combat sequencesCons:-Too many jokes-Story is all over the place-Towards the end things stop making senseIt's a good debut for a new game from Telltale.

Your name is Lee Everett. A thirty-something year old man on his way to prison for an undisclosed crime. The game begins with you getting driven out of the city of Atlanta by an elderly policeman. This is a tutorial of sorts as you learn how to look around and click on objects of interest. You also learn about the dialogue system in which you get given 4 options of words/sentences to reply with. Choose as you will, the copper looks away at a bad moment and crashes into a pedestrian, spins out of control and tumbles down a steep ditch on the side of the road. Dazed, confused and hurt you pass out for a few minutes to the sound of screaming. This is where the game really begins.

Half-Life is a game that came out in 1998 and is the first game ever created by valve.

Aliens appear all over the place and it's up to the main character ( Gorden Freeman ) to get to the bottom of it, and if possible stop it.

This game is made for people who are 18 years and older. The question I have is why is this game a ""low violence version"" it is only for people 18 years and older. I understand its because its pretty full on. Being an adult means you have access to Uncensored stuff, adult movies, guns, etc. But why is this game censored for adults who paid good money for something that should not be censored. The logic makes no sence. Even the South Park TV show is Uncensored at MA+15. Why Censore a game at R+18? This is absolutely Outrageous. ITS SOUTHPARK. COME ON.

Yes.TL;DRBanished is a challenging (but fantastic) city builder which strays from the rest as it is not your typical city builder; instead of huge capital cities that we see in games like Cities: Skylines, Banished focuses on a small town with a low budget. Personally, I think it is one of the best games in the city building genre. That said, however, the AI of the villagers is rather mediocre, and at the moment there isn't a whole lot to it's (beautiful) bones. This game can provide hours of good, challenging fun, but don't come expecting anything like Cities: Skylines. Also note that this game is very hard, and may be frustrating to those new to the genre, even experienced city builders will also need to have a few tries to get used to it's somewhat complicated mechanics and challenge. Banished has a bit of a lack of tutorials, so don't expect that you will understand everything right away.Banished is fantastic and challenging, but don't come expecting another Cities: Skylines.After many tries and hours of understanding every little mechanic, I have finally formed a functional city with a good population. Yet in this game, someething, small or big, will fail, and everything will completely go down hill. That is the thing with Shining Rock Software's 2014 city builder Banished, there is and always will be an underlying threat. Whether it's famine, cold, a natural disaster, your town will eventually go to the pigs.Your town starts off with a few small, hopeful families, a storage barn, and a stock pile with not a hell of a lot of starting resources. You start off building a few small wooden houses, you make some gatherer's huts, forester lodges, nothing too big. Your town will slowly grow in population and size, and soon you have a city on your hands. However, don't expect it to be a Cities: Skylines type thing where you can just sit back and watch your city work, you need to keep your eyes on the game at all times. One time I had a town-wide famine, because the road from one of the gatherer's huts to the storage barn was too long. Couldn't understand why everyone kept dying of starvation. While it is occasionally very frustrating, it is a very addictive game, and sometimes when everything goes bad the game really shines. The dire need of resources, the feeling of hope, the game will immerse you. So, lets get into the pros and the cons.Pros-Addictive-Challenging-A blast of fresh air-Cool art style and general feel-Interesting seeing your town work and grow from the teamwork of all your villagers-Immersive-Lots to achieve and work to-Relatively simple-Pretty good map generation settings-Weather cycles which can mean life or death-Lots of different ways to approach things; you could use a gatherer to gather food from the forest, use aquired seeds to make farms, or maybe just buy all your resources off the trading post, you can decide-Villagers aren't just lifeless robots, they have needs and happiness which can be fulfilled in different ways-Natural disasters are a cool feature which you need to prepare for-Gives you a good overview of statistics in your townCons-Villager AI is mediocre at best-Not great control over a few different things like villager paths and resource management-Not a hell of a lot on it's bones yet-Lack of tutorials, just throws you in the deep end-UI can be a little hard to navigate-Some resources like rocks are not unlimited, and will eventually run out (this takes a long time though)-Annoying little bugs which can destroy your cityWell, that's basically that. Banished has a fair share of cons, just like any game, but I personally think it deserves a solid 8.5/10It serves as a fantastic ant farm simulator as well, seeing your people evolve and grow, seeing them get all wiped out (fun). It is one of my favourites in the city builder genre and any experienced city builder should pick up this game, but even newbies to the the genre can pick up this game and have fun.",2015-11-14

So there it sat in my vast Steam library, not really doing anything. And then, my friend told me about a really good city-builder that he had been playing. I thought, ""oh Simcity, right?"" Wrong. He was talking about Tropico, (Tropico 5 however). At this time, I had forgotten that I even had it. So, when I looked it up on the steam store, I realised that I already had it. So, I gave it a shot. And I was quite presently surprised! So, here is a list explaining the good and bad elements of Tropico 4 and there reasons.Pros+Each little person has their own profile;What was one of the elements that made Tropico stand out was the ability to click on every little person walking around, doing there daily routine. Once you clicked on them, a profile of the character came up, explaining their age, wellbeing, faction, name, where they work and where they live. It would also make the camera follow that person. Sometimes, I would find myself just seeing people go about their daily lives for hours on end.+In the population, there are structured families;A little more of a unnecessary part of the game, (but undoubtedly cool) was the structured families. Sometimes when checking people's profiles, you may find a group of people with the same last name. At first, I thought ths was just due to the developers not putting enough names in. But then, I executed a guy, and then everybody with the same last name as him got enraged. Confused, I looked at the effects of executing someone, and it said; ""victim's family will become enraged"" and thats when I realised, there was families, which is really cool!+A system where technology evolves with time;Much like Civilization V (which is an utterly fantastic strategy game), technology would advance as time goes on. This means, that I might start out with some crappy tenements, but when I research more stuff, I could have super high-tec shopping malls. Nuff said.+The ability of extreme POWER;In this game, you have the power of anything and everything on the island, (apart from the rebels, which we will get to later). None of the decisions will be made for you, you have to make them. There are recomendations for what to build, but I mostly found myself ignoring them, as sometimes they can screw you over.+Rebels;The rebels system in this game is rather good. It's simple, when someone becomes too unhappy with the island, they will become a rebel. Rebels can and will screw you over. They will start fires, attack buildings and people and generally become out of control.+Disasters;Perhaps copying other citybuilders, this game has disasters. Dont worry though, you won't be having meteors or aliens or...dinosaurs *cough*Simcity*cough*. Just normal things like nuclear bombs or volcano eruptions or earthquakes. And it won't just be mildly annoying either, it will seriously screw you over. Once, when I built my city next to a volcano, thinking it would look pretty cool, lets just say it wasn't cool when flying blobs of lava engulfed the city and I went financialy in debt.So, thats the list of things which I think are pretty cool in this game. Now, we will talk about the cons.Cons-Limited time;The thing I can think of straight off the bat is that it has a limited amount of time for a game, even in sandbox mode! Sure it is a while, but one time, I built a really great city...and then I couldn't play anymore because my ""mandate had run out"", and that was on maximum time. Sure, it adds realism, but sometimes fun should overweigh how realistic it is. This is where Just Cause 2 shined, now you might be thinking, ""what the devil, what on Earth has that got ot do with Tropico?!"" well, my friend; nothing. I was just bringing it up. Anyways, the reason Just Cause 2 was so fun is that it was completely unrealistic. Tropico should get some inspiration off that.-Lack of help;One of the annoying things about this game is that it just throws you in with ""build a city"". This is a large downside, as the game is quite complicated in the financial part of things. Alot of the time, I found myself looking at my amount of money, going down by the thousands, completely confused why.-Graphics;Now, I would like to point out that this is a very small and minor problem, especially considering it's a citybuilder. But the graphics are a little lacking.Final VerdictSo, we are down to the final verdict, and, if you couldn't already tell with the big blue thumbs up stamped on, I most certainly recomend Tropico 4! Even though it has flaws, I can still say this is a great, solid citybuilder. Thank you for taking some time to read this!",2015-04-06

Then his colorblind   dwarf daughter goes to the castle. She dies too!

I thought this was just going to be another minecraft clone, but the way it looks and the way it runs. Honestly I like it, for an early access game it appears to have a lot of content, and it runs smoothly even on the highest settings for me. Though there are microtransactions at the moment, the devs have already told me they are trying to rethink the way they will do this due to popular demand. I made a video of it, I planned to stop at 30 minutes but I just got that into it that I ended up going for an hour. End of the day I would reccomend it, though I havent tried multiplayer as none of my friends have it... yet :Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6j9mm3Q6cA",2014-08-13

Aside from one regularly occuring crash, the only bugs I encounter are just plain hilarious and actually make the game more enjoyable. I only purchased this game not even a week ago and im already at 24 hours of playing I think. Considering the features which apparently are planned, this game will be one of those ones you just wont get sick of.",2014-02-03

The graphical details are amazing and I really enjoy the scenery aswell. Playing as the Monster at first was a little tricky, however once you find a routine you can win almost every time. PLaying as the Hunters, well it is quite literally relying on teamwork to bring down a monster, no mattter if the monster is level one, two or three. But having said that hunters are fun to play because of their 'individual' abilities and I really like the way they have made them all unique in some way shape or form.The only bad thing I have to say about this game is that it's gameplay and styles once you have been playing alot really does get repetitive.To sum this up, combined with the gameplay, the details, the hunter and the monster uniqueness and then taken into fact about some gameplays being repetitive, I will rate it 8/10 and people, it is definately worth trying out :)",2015-06-13

I would suggest even for those who aren't that keen to grab the game when it comes on sale ($3.75) as you can make your money back, just from selling items you get in game for free. This game is what is fuelling my game purchases from now on. Besides from that, it's a great FPS, but is more then just a FPS. It uses strategy, teamwork, and commitment, all of which have resulted in a (mostly) good community. It's also has custom features, so you can choose your weapon skins, and can buy ""DLC"" packs that support community modders.  And to finish it off, it's got continued dev support, so it will (hopefully) only get better.",2014-06-04

Overall it is a good game. Unlike other economic strategy games which are broad (""Build a Farm"" - what sort of farm? Pig farm? Cow Farm? Ladybug farm?) it is much like stronghold, in the way that it is more specific for each category (E.G you can choose a weapon factory, furniture etc.) although that does come at a cost (just like in stronghold) as it limits the amount of categories there are.

Fun and intriguing with a story that isn't force fed to you. Combat is very precise and very rarely feels cheap or unfair. There is large game world with many interesting and breathtaking environments that are filled with a wide variety of enemies from grotesque monsters to heavily armoured warriors.I also liked the multiplayer aspect. Seeing shadows of other players, interacting with their bloodspots on the ground to see how they died, getting summoned to another world to help slay a boss, and getting invaded by other players. PVP battles are incredibly tense, the tactics that worked on NPCs don't always work with players, and you know that the oponent you facing is no novice gamer. Perhaps not as revolutionary as Dark Souls 1 but it's still a very challenging and enjoyable experience that I thoroughly enjoyed.9/10. Death is just the beginning",2014-05-31

The gameplay to my knowledge hasn't been changed much, and thats not a bad thing. Solid and addictive gameplay mixed with the graphical upgrade makes for an even better game then KF1.Even though this game is great, its unfinished. My personal favorite class from KF1, the Sharpshooter, isn't avalable yet in KF2. There are also other classes that are new to the game that havn't been implomented yet like the gunslinger that I badly want to try, but sadly they arn't avalable yet. Hopefuly there will be a update soon that adds in new classes, and a haloween sale so I can buy cheaper.TL;DR:Is the game good? Absolutly 100% yes.Is it worth $30? Debatably yes, depends on the date and upcoming sales.Would I reccommend it for $30? Absolutly, but again, this depends on the person.Will I buy it for $30? No, but only because haloween is right around the corner (review written on 24 of oct) and im hoping it'll go on sale.",2015-10-24

In all seriousness, this game has been with me for a while and I have gifted it to a few people in an attempt to get the highest score between all of us, not an easy task. This game combines addictive chiptunes with BRUTAL gameplay that will make you want to smash your head into your keyboard, then pick up the remains and stab it. Multiple times. Who ever thought surviving one minute could be so difficult? Obviously not me!Pros:-Addictive gameplay-Competitive gameplay for the highest score in your group-Great soundtrack-Wonderful color palette (in my oppinion)Cons:-Too short-Once the patterns are memorized it becomes significantly easier-I only find myself playing for about 30-40min at a timeRating: 8/10.

XP has a maximum ram of exactly 4 gb, and 1.2 ish is taken up by needed processes, so you have 2.8 gb ram for a 4 gb ram game, and steam won't even open it if you can't manage it.

I have a new-ish PC, but because i'm almose broke, i have an old graphics card.

Bleed is a small 2d platformer where you control the character known as Wryn who wants to become the Greatest Hero of All Time but the heroes have already been chosen so you have to go and kill them and take you rightfull place. It is also a fast-paced action platformer which involves loads of bullets and enemies being thrown at you while you while having bullet time and control over your character at which in no point in time is trying to screw you over. The Game also and upgrades and weapons that you can purchase with points by playing the levels.With everything but the kitchen sink coming towards your general direction it can be quite difficult trying to avoid it and you will die quite a bit at the start (Either I just suck or I'm telling the truth) but unlike most games where it insults you for dying, it doesn't really do it in Bleed, Infact half the time Wryn is actually conforting me for my loss saying things like ""Don't worry we'll get them next time""The Bullet time mechanic is really quite neat and helpful and also quite balanced. There is a separate bar for bullet time: Using it in short bursts will allow it to recharge a little and you will be able to use it again, Use it untill the bar goes to zero and you will have to wait untill it refills again to use bullet time once more and that could involve getting hurt when you needed it the most.I've also noticed the game is very generous in check points meaning it will not send you to the very beginning of that room or level, it's as if the developer knew that it might be a tad bit difficult on players. Now I can't really explain how it all works but just play the game and you will see what I mean.The soundtrack in this game is fantabolus (yes I purposely did that) there is not a single song that I didn't like. It fits in with the enviroment it is placed in and it has that old school 8-bit feel to it, especially the boss music.There is also Co-op in this game, I don't anyone else to play with so yea :C but I had a look on youtube and it's quite nice. Still don't know how it works but it looks good.I have no complaints about this game: It has great fulid control, awesome soundtrack, fast-paced gameplay, a good challenge and a good price. There is however one thing that I am not fond of and that is the length of the game. while there are other things like arcade, challenge mode and other difficulties to play on, I just find this game to be a little to short and could have been better game than what is already was but hey, don't let that stop ya from buying this game cuz it is worth the price.In conclusion I think that this is a great game to play and I had fun every single second of it and for 4.99 Its worth it all the way.........Well what are you waiting for? Go buy it already!",2014-06-09

That being said Phantom Breaker is its own game and what a fun game it is.It's a beat-em up game with anime-like characters and awesome chip-tune music. The Game can be a bit repetive for some but I love it none the lessPros: -Music-Characters: really fun to use and you can unlock more of them in storymode-2D graphics look gourgeous-Gameplay-Stages are really nice.-Multiplayer (haven't really tested it since at the moment its only local at the moment)-Skill Point system-Lengthy: not one of those games you can really complete in one day.-Making combos is awesome.Middlepoint-Later enemies are reskins of previous ones but they have their differences and look interesting. Not just some palette swap-Controls and mechanics are a bit confusing in how they work but it's enough to have fun with.-The Storymode for a single character can go on for a bit, not to long but your hands will get a tad bit tired afterwards.- The game tends to bunch a crapload of enemies into one room and with the weird guarding mechanic working only for some attacks it can get a bit difficult. Still you should enjoy beating the hell out of them with combos.- The Story is bloody confusing for these characters. Either way still interesting.Cons-Remember when I spoke about the whole controls and mechanics thing. Yea some attacks it will block but for bigger guys or stronger attacks dodging it is very hard. Not to mention dodging itself is difficult and you can be beaten the crap out of by enemies. -You will find later on these weird blue/red ball enemies that have these tape claws or something. The mechanics make it either very difficult or impossible to avoid their attacks. That might just be me but its annoying none the less.-You better have a Controller for this because this is one of those games where the PC keyboard inputs are placed in weird places, The control help shows a console controller and you can not change the inputs at all. So yea, Have fun.-Difficulty Spikes on these bosses go up quite a bit and with the confusing mechanics. It can be difficult.As you can see this game has quite flaws but don't let that stop you. I had a lot of fun playing this and with the online mode being annouced recently, maybe soon I'll have friend to play with. It's my kind of game. maybe not to all, but at least to me. Though I would recommend buying it when it goes on sale like what I did.Overall I think the game gets a 7/10. Not the best but no where near bad at all.

Ele jogou o cigarro que estava fumando no chão e falou que nunca mais ia fumar e se esforçou muito pra cumprir essa promessa, infelizmente, três anos depois ele morreu de câncer de pulmão. Foi muito triste e realmente me destruiu por dentro. A minha mãe desde então ficou me dizendo: ''Nunca fume. Por favor não deixe sua família passar pela mesma tristeza que seu avô nôs fez passar''.

Admittedly, I am not a big fan of puzzle games that involves a stealth mechanic, but with the unique mechanic that is the 'Crosslink' system, the game becomes a lot less of just waiting and moving and waiting and moving, but instead becomes more like setting up a complex mouse trap that incapacitates every guard in the building with the flick of a switch. And that's where the fun comes from, not the hiding and the stakes of being found, but trying to find the quickest and easiest way to the objective through utilisation of the environment. The story is clever, well written, but short. the level design is top-notch, and with the implementation of a steam workshop supported level editor, I can see a much longer playtime through the various community levels.Oh, and you get a TF2 hat.So, even if you don't like stealth games, there's a demo that you can test the water with.

I accused it of suffering from a ""terrible lack of content"", primarily due to the fact that it only had ""4 classes, one which was broken"" (Zerker).I dare say that I've played enough of the new update to wish that I'd waited until the patch had been released before giving this game a negative rating.This is due to the fact that yes, Tripwire did take a long time in releasing it, and yes, there was a lack of content in time waiting for the new update, however, I can honestly say that it was all worth it.Every second.The new content is incredible, the Zerker tree has been completely re-worked, and it now functions as well as any other class in the game. The FLEX Gore system is beautiful (THE GIBS, MAN, THE GIBS).The new maps are unbelievably well-done. Catacombs is an underground area (as you'd expect from the name) where almost every light can be destroyed, plunging the map into almost complete darkness. It is claustrophobic, nigh on terrifying when played on the hardest difficulty, adrenaline pumping, and indescribably enjoyable to play.Evacuation Point is just as well done, but it isn't as original as Catacombs. Whilst it is beautifully made, with some lovely tight spots to get stuck in, there is little that differs it from the rest of the maps, whilst Catacombs is one of the most unique maps I've ever had the pleasure of suffering through.The two new classes are absolutely spectacular. Firebug is fun in a maniacal sort of way. Setting countless Zeds aflame with the Flamethrower and watching them writh around as they slowly burn to death always succeeds in elicting a psychotic grin on my face. The Microwave Gun is just, beautiful.Simply beautiful.There is nothing more enjoyable in Killing Floor 2 than watching a Zed inflate spectacularly before bursting into a satisfying shower of gibs and bodily fluids. And then there's the Demolitionist. Whilst the class could do with some re-working (it is a tad underpowered currently), I can't honestly say that I don't enjoy laying down C4 at chokepoints and waiting expectantly for a group of Zeds to walk by before blowing them all to smithereens, their intenstines flying all over the place, their blood splattering the walls as I giggle with glee behind the keyboard. Ahem. Aside from the brilliant new content, there were numerous bug-fixes and other improvements present. Namely, Tripwire did away with (or at least reduced the effect of) Zed Teleporting, which was one of my primary reasons for giving the game a negative rating. Furthermore, they improved Han's' intro, along with some of his attacks, visual effects, and other things. This, amongst with countless other improvements, all work spectacularly, with nary a bug in sight. I've gotta say Tripwire, I'm very bloody impressed.",2015-08-22

Who says a simple game can be something giant like a mundial tournament.This movie doesn't only for DotA specially but for every single competitive game. Also raise up a great reflection, worth give up of college, family, friends and of live your always-life just for do what you like and be paid for it?Even if you're not a DotA player watch this, worth so much, I honestly don't play but is the second time that I see since was released last year and is amazing the way they retract and show what is e-sports, furthermore is just 1h29min.:D :)   Análise em português :Melhor documentário sobre o que é e-sports, apesar de o foco ser APENAS no DotA, já mostra o quão incrível é essa área. Quem diria que um simples jogo pode se transformar em algo grande como um torneio mundial.Esse filme não serve apenas para DotA mas para os jogos competitivos em geral. E também levanta uma grande reflexão, será que vale a pena deixar os estudos de lado, família, amigos e de viver a sua vida de sempre para fazer o que você gosta e ser pago por isso?Mesmo que você não jogue DotA assista esse documentário, vale muito a pena, eu não jogo mas é a segunda vez que assisto desde quando lançou ano passado e é inacreditável a maneira que eles retratam e o mostram o que são e-sports, além do mais é apenas 1h29m.:D :)",2015-10-20

Do you realize how monumental this game was (and seemingly still is) to gamers and even to Valve themselves? Steam Achievement and later drop system along with hats were first introduced for TF2. I remember when hat phenomenon was all over the place and everyone wanted Fancy Fedora so much.Here is one fun story about the game; A guy from SourceOP known as Drunken F00l got VAC-banned for making idling tool for TF2 and for cheating an event item known as Golden Wrench. Including him, people who used idling tool got their hats and items taken away meanwhile all other active TF2 players were awarded with Halo hats for not using the tool. But after sometime the ban on the SourceOP guy was lifted and he officially started working at Valve for his TF2 Backpack and something more. Well, that guy had talent and Valve definitely knew about it so they decided to hire him in spite of all violations of user agreements as a Steam user. It reminds me of the FBI hiring a genius financial fraudster and there is even a movie about it. So much drama over TF2, aye? You see, this game just has so many interesting stories to tell.When TF2 switched to F2P model, the community even got bigger and stronger than ever before and it is still growing even after many years have passed. All official updates and endless user-created contents enrich the game; more drops, more hats, more weapons, more maps, more Halloween and holiday events, more updates, more everything, and now skins just like in CS:GO; OMG VOLVO. And its market is being sustained on its own economy. Quite amazing. I personally no longer play this game anymore because I already played enough of it, but it is easily understandable why this game is still one of the most played games on Steam.. RECOMMENDED .",2014-10-17

It's very addictive, and the only negative thing I have to say is that I wish there was something to spend all your money on in game, like with Payday 2.

2301,Frankaloons,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frankaloons,Last edited June 29.,107410,3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,"Arma 3 is a military simulation game. Let me tell you about it.First of all, some history.All of these titles lasted a few years, with continuing updates.Operation Flashpoint came out in 2001, and was a very good game for it's time.ARMA: Armed Assault was released in 2006, and was also a very good game.ARMA 2 was released in 2009, and was probably the best WW2 shooter out there, if not the best shooter, and is still being played today.Arma 3 was released in 2013. Now, this little game is seriously the next gen stuff. With amazing graphics and sounds, a new story-rich campaign, a futuristic setting and beautiful, lush terrain on huge maps is what made it stand out at the time.The game is set in the republic of Altis and Stratis, which are both small Greek islands, although they're MASSIVE for a game's map. There are three teams fighting for these islands, first of all are the locals, the AAF or Independents. They are the Altan Army Forces, and, because pressured by their local guerilla crisis, have made some European and American allies, NATO, or BLUFOR. Although, towards the end of the first episode of the campaign, there are 'entanglements' and the AAF decide to turn on NATO, and then CSAT, a a combination of Asian forces, teams with the AAF. Also, NATO is having a financial crisis. Oh, what fun.It has a few original gamemodes, which were released with the game originally, but so many more have come from the vast modding community.Altis Life, Wasteland, Invade and Annex and Breaking Point are just a few examples. I'll tell you a little bit about each.First of all, Altis Life. It's a very exadurated take on real life. With cops, medics and civilians. As a civilian, you can make your money in legal ways, like apple picking and mining with a liscence, although you can make it in illegal ways like drugs and turtle poaching. You can also go to a rebel town and buy some illegal gear and do more illegal things.As a cop, you'll have to stop all this illegal behaviour. Doing searches and inforcing the law, rebels will have to look out for these guys.And medics, if you're injured, can come and revive you. May sound simple, but it's actually a very dangerous job.Here's a very good Altis Life server: http://reignofterrorclan.enjin.com/With Wasteland, you have your three teams, BLUFOR, OPFOR and Independent.As BLUFOR or OPFOR, you have to work together with your team to kill the other team and the Independents, while getting money from missions or killing players to buy new things, like guns and veichles.As an independent, you're in a massive free for all against the other teams and all the other independents, unless you group up with some others.Here's a very good Wasteland server: https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/play.ultimatewasteland.com:2302/With Breaking Point, it's a zombie game, so basically DayZ. DayZ started as an Arma 2 mod, which eventually became a standalone game. Now, however, it's also an Arma 3 mod. Scavenge for supplies, kill or befriend other players while watching out for zombies.Sign up to play here: http://www.thezombieinfection.com/Also, Invade and Annex is more of a slow paced military simulation. With classes, you can pick your role and fight against enemy AI for the islands. Using all of the game's original content and a little bit more, this gamemode is seriously some good fun if you're more of a strategic fighter.It is overall an ultra realistic game, with tons of veichles, models and weapons, even very realistic weather and day - night cycles, and there's a lot more stuff from the modding community. It has a really steep price at $60, but I picked it up on special, and even if I did buy it for the original price, it's worth it. Trust me, it's worth it.If my horrible explanation didn't help you, check out the Arma 3 Youtube channel. If it did help you, check it out anyway.https://www.youtube.com/user/Arma3officialThanks for reading my review and, if you decide to get the game, I hope to see you!Frank",2015-02-23
2302,Frankaloons,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frankaloons,,4000,2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful,True,"Okay, so I'm hearing you ask ""Why should I buy Garry's Mod?"" Well, you'd find that a silly question too if you'd been through the same experience some of us have been.And now, I just want to say, the reason I'm writing this review is because it's one of my favourite games. My favourite, probably. But I also want you to know I could say ""I recommend this game, it's awesome"" and be done with it. But that's not what makes you want to buy a game.So, first off, a history lesson. Garry's Mod started off as a mod for Half Life 2. You play through standard Half Life 2, whilist spawning in whacky inventions to help you along the way. It's so much more than that now.It still runs off the same Half Life 2 game engine, like CS:S and TF2 do. I guess it would be classified an FPS sandbox game. But you can change that.You can spawn in classic Half Life 2 props, weapons, entities, npcs, spawn in other peoples creations, go into other people's worlds, try out some other classic gamemodes like Jailbreak, Trouble in Terrorist Town or DarkRP.There are also lots of things that aren't from the Half Life 2 game in sandbox. Tools. Weld, duplicate, face posing, weight and so many more.What's that you say? You want more? We can handle that too. This is where the game really shines. Addons. If you go onto the main menu, they'll be a tab called 'Addons'. This is where you can keep all of other players, and you're own creations and mods. Modern Weapons, cars, nuclear missiles! Without addons, you would only have standard sandbox. All gamemodes, such as Melonbomber, TTT, HL2RP, Zombie Survival etc. couldn't exist without addons!Some textures and props you can't get through addons which is understandable for this kind of sandbox game. For CS:S props, you need CS:S. There's DOD, TF2, L4D, HL, DH, etc. Once you have these mounted, (main menu, click the game controller, and tick the boxes in the list) just go into your singleplayer sandbox, and there, in the main props list, will be the ragdolls, props etc. from the games.I reckon this pretty much concludes my very brief review of the game that is Garry's Mod. All the rest... that's for you to find out.Over 'n' out,-Frank",2014-07-28

I love looking at them.It features very functional turrets (manned/unmanned), and a great cover system.It also features an array of game modes and a huge community for you to play with.I know that's not much to go on, but trust me, it's a great mod, and it's free!All it requires (I think) is that you own a source game (That worked for me, anyway).Frank",2015-03-15

2305,Frankaloons,http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frankaloons,,275700,No ratings yet,True,"The Zeus DLC for Arma 3 is, in my opinion, better than any other DLC or mod.Basically, if you go into the Editor, and you place some things, setup a little scenario for a few guys to play, that's all well and good. Although, if you want to make a much more enjoyable experience for yourself and the players, or if you think the editor is too fiddly and hard to use, use Zeus.Zeus allows you to use the default editor, but in 3D, with easier to use placement and editing panels. Also, you can change things while players are  in game.  Brilliant.It's very hard to explain something so amazing in word form, so check out the video below to get a better grasp on Zeus.www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR_TN_XiZNEAlso, make sure you check out the official Arma 3 Channel.https://www.youtube.com/user/Arma3officialI hope my brief review has somewhat helped you, go enjoy it yourself!",2015-05-12

2334,farmerbillson,http://steamcommunity.com/id/farmerbillson,,227680,1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful,False,"StarForge is a game with big ambitions but offers little fun whatsoever. It is true that people buying star forge should consider the fact it is in alpha but that being said, the game itself is barely in a playable state. The world's are dull and lifeless, lacking any sort of explorability past the opening area despite the game advertising ""procedural voxel terrain"". The game is set on the premise of a survival game in which enemies come in waves. This sounds pretty standard in theory and seems like an easy basis for a game but StarForge manages to get it all wrong. The waves are slow and tedious, the enemies lack variety and any sort of intelligent A.I and the weapons are dreadful. I have never played a game with gun mechanics as bad as StarForge, they're just dreadful.The enemies have basic animations which don't show when it is actually in a state of death so you are often left shooting the enemy for prolonged periods of time as the fact is, the enemies animations don't show life even when it should be living. You control horrendously in StarForge. Moving, one of the simplest of tasks, is made hard by sluggish movement and bad mouse control. The saturation of motion blur is almost sickening and the lack of any choice to turn it off just makes it even worst. StarForge however does one thing interesting with the movement which is in the form of ragdoll-esque falling. It can provide some laughs as you fly into objects and spaz the hell out when falling but is anything but a good gameplay feature and more of a humerous addition. The games building is a clunky system which like most of the games systems works great in theory but fails to pratically work.  The simple idea of cube-based building is ruined by the games approach to the building system as well as a lack of world modification which seems like something the game needed from the start. StarForge makes a lot of promises and doesn't deliver on any of them to the point where writing this review felt more like a winge as I could not think of one thing I liked about the game. One can only hope that in future updates the game gains some sort of solidity but the fact of the matter is that StarForge isn't playable by any stretch of the imagination and a lot of work will need to be put in to give it's buyers a reason to enjoy it.",2013-11-29

VSTEP made this as a ""side project"" and never has fully unleased the potential of this Simulator. Their 2006 release was quite good except it was missing a few bits. In 2008 they made the next sequel. Finnaly they finished patching it up and I hoped they would expand it a bit more but it was playable. Now we have this ""ship simulator extremes"" but it's extreme failiure. Why show Ship enthusiasts one thing and then when you get it, it's not as amazing as the screenshots. It's quite under-developed. Sure the enviroment like the water looks better-ish but the same simple an basic ship simulation is in place, there is no complexity in this simulator. Some boats are missing sounds still. Worste of all VSTEP are truly control-live of this simulator, we cannot add our own mods to it, it's VSTEP or no improvement. Back in 2008 we were able to produce more realistic horns and radio chatter as well as lights. There is soo much more VSTEP could of done here but they are refusing to.
